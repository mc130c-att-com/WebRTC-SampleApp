# AT&T Enhanced WebRTC API Java Sample Application

This sample app demonstrates the features of the AT&T Enhanced WebRTC API,
enabling you to quickly test the API, view code snippets, and better understand
the elements of this API.

This file covers basic setup, configuration, and launch of the sample app,
including steps required to register the app, generate the API App Key and App
Secret, configure the Jetty server with Java, and run the fully functional
sample app.

## <a name="registration"></a> Registration

This section describes the necessary steps to register an app with the proper
services and endpoints.

To register an app and obtain the appropriate keys for AT&T APIs, you must
enroll in the AT&T Developer Program at the [AT&T Developer Program Web
site](http://developer.att.com/). If you don't have an existing account, you
can create one by clicking "Get Started Free." Your account must have premium
access in order to use the WebRTC API.

To register an app:

1. Sign in to your AT&T Developer Program account.
2. Select _My Apps_.
3. Click _Set Up New App_ and enter the required information.
4. Choose _Enhanced WebRTC_ from the list of APIs.
5. Complete the information necessary to use Enhanced WebRTC.

**Note:** the **OAuth Redirect URL** field must contain the URL where you want
the OAuth provider to redirect users when they successfully authenticate and
authorize your app. For the sample app the default should be set to
http://localhost:8080.

Once your app is registered, you will receive an App Key and App
Secret, which enable your app to communicate with the AT&T Enhanced WebRTC API.

A newly registered app is restricted to the Sandbox environment. When
you're ready to move it to the Production environment, click **Promote to
production**. Note: _When you promote your app to the Production
environment, you must update the application.properties file with
Production-specific keys and settings._


Depending on the type of authentication you configure, your app may use either
the Autonomous Client or the Web Server Client OAuth flow. For more
information, see the [OAuth page](https://developer.att.com/apis/oauth-2/docs)
on the AT&T Developer Program Web site.

## <a name="install"></a> Installation

This section describes the steps necessary to install this sample app on a
Jetty server using Java.

Requirements:

 - [Java JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html)
 - [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html)
 - [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
 - [A WebRTC-compatible browser](http://developer.att.com/sdks-plugins/enhanced-webrtc#using-webrtc-sdk)

Install the Java JRE, Java JDK, and Apache Maven according to their respective
documentation.

## <a name="config"></a> Configuration

Each sample app contains an application.properties file in the
'src/main/resources/' folder, which contains configurable parameters with
comments to guide you through the configuration process.

The following are short descriptions of commonly used parameters:

**REQUIRED**

1. FQDN: The main server handling requests. For example, https://api.att.com.
2. clientId: The App Key you obtained when you set up your app.
3. clientSecret: The App Secret you obtained when you set up your app.
4. accountDomain: The Org Domain you entered when you set up your app.
5. redirectUri: Required for authorization flow. Using Jetty, the default is http://localhost:8080/webrtc/index.jsp.

**OPTIONAL**

1. e911Id: The E911 identifier generated by the E911 API.
2. vtnNumbers: A list of comma-separated Virtual Numbers created when you set up your app.
3. proxyHost: Your server proxy setting, if required.
4. proxyPort: The port for your server proxy, if required.
5. trustAllCerts: Set to true to skip SSL validation. Note: Change this setting only if
   you are certain you wish to bypass SSL.

This sample app also uses a config.js file, located in the /js directory, which
you must update with your app-specific details.

**REQUIRED**

1. dhs: set this to the base URL for your application, without a
   trailing slash (/). The default value for this sample app is
   http://localhost:8080/webrtc.
2. ewebrtc\_domain: The Org Domain you entered when you set up your app.

## <a name="running"></a> Running the App

You can build this project using Apache Maven, and it follows Maven's Standard
Directory Layout. For more information about Apache Maven and detailed
instructions, consult the Apache Maven documentation.

Using a terminal, change the current directory to the sample app's root folder,
which should be the directory containing pom.xml. Run the following command to
build and run the application:

```shell
mvn clean jetty:run
```

This command should run the app on port 8080. Make sure no other application is
running on port 8080. To change the port, consult the Jetty documentation. To
connect to the sample app, open a web browser and visit
'http://localhost:8080/webrtc/index.jsp'.

If you would like to build a .war file to run on a Java Web server such as
Tomcat, use the following command:

```shell
mvn clean package
```
